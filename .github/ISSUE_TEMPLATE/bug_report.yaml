      description: >
        Describe in detail the exact steps that someone else can take to
        reproduce this bug using the current stable release of Kea-HA. Begin with the
        creation of any necessary database objects and call out every operation being
        performed explicitly. If reporting a bug in the REST API, be sure to reconstruct
        the raw HTTP request(s) being made. Additionally, **do not rely on the demo instance** for reproducing
        suspected bugs, as its data is prone to modification or deletion at any time.
